# ReadSlot — Complete Product, Engineering, Delivery, and Open-Source Blueprint

This is ReadSlot's canonical product and engineering specification.

**Document status:** Implemented beta baseline; OAuth verification pending  
**Version:** 2.1  
**Project type:** Free, local-first Chrome extension  
**Primary platform:** Google Chrome / Chromium browsers  
**Distribution target:** Chrome Web Store, GitHub Releases, source installation  
**Recommended license:** MIT  
**Source foundation:** Fork/derivative of `zarazhangrui/reading-block` (MIT)

---

# 0. Executive Decision Summary

**Implementation status (2026-07-13):** The version 0.9.0 Chrome-first beta is implemented with
a clean TypeScript foundation, on-demand `activeTab` capture, explicit Calendar confirmation,
local imports/exports, automated tests, release tooling, and store assets. Real OAuth smoke tests
and the production package require environment-specific Chrome Extension OAuth client IDs.

## Product decision

Build a free, privacy-first browser extension that saves articles, videos, PDFs, documentation, repositories, and other web content, analyzes the user's Google Calendar, and **suggests suitable reading blocks**.

The extension must never create a calendar event without explicit confirmation.

## Development decision

Use:
- TypeScript
- Manifest V3
- Vite
- React for extension pages
- Chrome Identity API
- Google Calendar API
- IndexedDB for the reading queue
- Vitest for unit tests
- Playwright for browser tests
- Local verification before every push
- GitHub Projects for sprint planning

No paid AI API is required.

## Open-source decision

**Yes, keep the project open source.**

Recommended approach:
- Fork the original MIT repository or clearly acknowledge it as the foundation.
- Retain the original copyright and MIT license notices.
- Add your own copyright notice for new work.
- Use the MIT license for continued compatibility and low contribution friction.
- Publish releases through the Chrome Web Store and GitHub.
- Keep OAuth client configuration and release keys under maintainer control.
- Never commit private keys, refresh tokens, test-user data, or release credentials.

## Core product promise

> Save now. Choose a suggested time. Actually read it.

# 1. Product Requirements Document

## 1.1 Product name

Product name: **ReadSlot**

Tagline: **Schedule what you save.**

ReadSlot is the canonical product, extension, and repository name. It replaced the former working name on 2026-07-13 after a preliminary collision review. Before publication, it must still receive formal Chrome Web Store, GitHub, domain, and trademark clearance.

## 1.2 Vision

People do not need another place to store links. They need help creating realistic time to consume what they save.

ReadSlot transforms a passive reading backlog into intentional calendar sessions while preserving human control.

## 1.3 Mission

Help users reduce their saved-content backlog by:
1. Capturing content with minimal friction.
2. Estimating the amount of time needed.
3. Identifying realistic free periods.
4. Suggesting candidate reading sessions.
5. Requiring explicit confirmation.
6. Reviewing outcomes and rescheduling unfinished content.

## 1.4 Problem statement

Users commonly save:
- Articles
- Videos
- Technical documentation
- PDFs
- Research papers
- GitHub repositories
- Reddit posts
- Newsletters
- Tutorials
- Courses
- Threads

The content accumulates in bookmarks, tabs, read-later services, messages, and notes.

Most read-later products solve collection and presentation. They do not adequately solve allocation of time.

The result is:
- Large backlogs
- Forgotten content
- Guilt and decision fatigue
- Repeated saving of duplicates
- Poor follow-through
- Unused bookmarks
- Overloaded browser sessions

## 1.5 Product principles

1. **Human in the loop**  
   Suggestions are automatic. Calendar creation is manual.

2. **Local first**  
   Reading data stays on the user's device unless explicitly exported.

3. **Minimal permissions**  
   Request only permissions required for capture, scheduling, and notifications.

4. **No paid dependency**  
   Core functionality must operate without paid APIs or subscriptions.

5. **Transparent behavior**  
   Explain why each time slot was suggested.

6. **Reversible actions**  
   The user can undo saves, cancel proposals, and remove created events.

7. **Queue reduction over queue growth**  
   The product should encourage completion, archiving, or deletion.

8. **Calendar respect**  
   Never book over existing events without a visible warning.

9. **Progressive complexity**  
   Simple defaults first; advanced options remain optional.

10. **Accessible by design**  
    Full keyboard support, semantic UI, visible focus, sufficient contrast, and screen-reader labels.

# 4. Jobs to Be Done

## Core job

> When I save useful content, help me reserve realistic time to consume it without making calendar decisions for me.

## Supporting jobs

- When I have a growing queue, show me its real time cost.
- When I have free calendar periods, suggest useful reading combinations.
- When a suggested period does not fit my plans, let me adjust it.
- When I fail to finish a session, help me reschedule without losing context.
- When content is no longer relevant, help me archive or remove it.
- When I revisit the same URL, tell me it is already saved.
- When my calendar changes, prevent stale suggestions from creating conflicts.

# 5. Market Position and Opportunity

## 5.1 Category

ReadSlot sits between:
- Read-later tools
- Calendar time-blocking tools
- Personal productivity tools
- Knowledge-management tools

It should not position itself as a complete reader or note-taking platform.

## 5.2 Positioning statement

> ReadSlot is a local-first scheduling assistant for saved content. It turns articles and videos into suggested calendar time while keeping the final decision with the user.

## 5.3 Differentiation

Traditional read-later tools:
- Save content
- Organize content
- Improve reading display
- Highlight and annotate

Calendar tools:
- Reserve time
- Show availability
- Remind users

ReadSlot:
- Connects saved content with available time
- Estimates backlog effort
- Suggests multiple blocks
- Requires confirmation
- Reviews outcomes
- Returns unfinished items to the queue

## 5.4 Opportunity

The strongest opportunity is not feature breadth. It is the behavioral gap between saving and consuming.

The product can win by being:
- Smaller than Readwise Reader
- More intentional than bookmarks
- Less autonomous than auto-schedulers
- More private than SaaS productivity platforms
- More transparent than AI scheduling tools
- Free and modifiable

## 5.5 Risks in the market

- Users may prefer simple bookmarks.
- Calendar permission can reduce installation conversion.
- Chrome Web Store users may distrust broad scopes.
- Read-later behavior is difficult to change.
- The product can become too complex.
- Existing calendar and task tools may add similar features.
- Google API policies may change.
- Maintaining a public extension requires ongoing security work.

## 5.6 Market validation plan

Before building advanced features:
1. Publish a landing page or README with screenshots.
2. Recruit 10–20 test users.
3. Track:
   - Saved items
   - Suggestions viewed
   - Suggestions accepted
   - Sessions completed
   - Queue reduction
4. Interview users after one week.
5. Ask:
   - Did suggested times feel realistic?
   - Did confirmation create too much friction?
   - Did calendar access feel trustworthy?
   - Which content types mattered most?
   - Did the extension help reduce backlog?

# 6. Functional Specification

# 6.1 Capture

## Requirements

The user can save:
- Current tab
- Right-clicked link
- Selected text plus current page
- PDF URL
- YouTube video
- GitHub repository
- Any valid HTTP or HTTPS page

## Saved metadata

- Unique ID
- Canonical URL

## YouTube

Preferred:
- Use duration available in page metadata or structured data.
- Do not scrape protected APIs or require API keys.
- If unavailable, use a user-configurable default.

## PDFs

Options:

- Use PDF.js locally.
- Allow manual override.
- Avoid downloading very large files automatically.

## GitHub repositories

Default estimate:
- README only: 10 minutes
- User override recommended
- Optional metadata from visible page only

## Unknown content

Default:
- 15 minutes
- User can change globally or per item.

## Rules

- Manual duration always overrides estimated duration.

# 7. Business Logic

## 7.1 Item states

```text
queued
proposed
scheduled
in_progress
completed
archived
deleted
```

## 7.2 Valid transitions

```text
queued -> proposed
queued -> scheduled
queued -> completed
queued -> archived
queued -> deleted

proposed -> queued
proposed -> scheduled
proposed -> archived
proposed -> deleted

scheduled -> in_progress
scheduled -> queued
scheduled -> completed
scheduled -> archived

in_progress -> completed
in_progress -> queued
in_progress -> archived

completed -> queued
completed -> archived
completed -> deleted

archived -> queued
archived -> deleted
```

## 7.3 Proposal states

```text
draft
ready
stale
confirmed
cancelled
expired
```

## 7.4 Scheduling rules

- A proposal can include one or more items.
- An item can belong to only one active confirmed session.
- An item may appear in multiple unconfirmed drafts only if clearly indicated.
- Confirming a proposal invalidates overlapping drafts containing the same item.
- Proposals expire after a configurable period, default 24 hours.
- Stale proposals must be revalidated.
- Calendar creation requires an explicit user action.
- Calendar availability must be rechecked within 30 seconds before creation.
- If the user chooses a conflicting time, require a second confirmation.

## 7.5 Priority rules

Priority values:
- High
- Normal
- Low
- Someday

Suggested ordering:
1. Due soon
2. High priority
3. Oldest
4. Shortest fitting item
5. Normal
6. Low
7. Someday only when explicitly included

## 7.6 Backlog rules

Queue health bands:
- Healthy: under 2 hours
- Growing: 2–5 hours
- Heavy: 5–10 hours
- Overloaded: over 10 hours

These thresholds must be configurable or presented as estimates, not judgments.

## 7.7 Duplicate logic

Normalize:
- Remove URL fragments unless required.
- Remove common tracking parameters.
- Normalize trailing slash.
- Lowercase host.
- Preserve meaningful query parameters.
- Resolve canonical URL only when safe.

Duplicate outcomes:
- Exact duplicate: show existing item.
- Canonical duplicate: offer merge.
- Same title, different URL: do not merge automatically.

## 7.8 Deletion rules

- Soft-delete first.
- Keep in trash for 30 days locally.
- Permanent deletion requires confirmation.
- Deleting an item does not automatically delete a calendar event unless the user chooses that action.
- Deleting a session should ask whether to return unfinished items to the queue.

# 14. Google OAuth Setup Guide

## 14.1 Important concept

OAuth removes setup burden for end users after the extension is published, but the maintainer still owns and configures the OAuth client.

End users should experience:

```text
Install extension
-> Click Connect Google Calendar
-> Choose Google account
-> Approve requested access
-> Use extension
```

They should not create their own Google Cloud project.

## 14.2 Development setup

1. Create a Google Cloud project.
2. Enable Google Calendar API.
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen.
4. Add development test users if the app is in testing mode.
5. Load the unpacked extension.
6. Copy the generated extension ID.
7. Create an OAuth client for a Chrome extension.
8. Associate it with the extension ID.
9. Add the client ID and scopes to `manifest.json`.
10. Test token acquisition with `chrome.identity.getAuthToken`.

## 14.3 Stable extension ID

During development and release, preserve a stable extension ID.

Options:
- Use the Chrome Web Store assigned ID for production.
- Use a manifest `key` for stable local development where appropriate.
- Never commit private signing material.

## 14.4 Scope strategy

Request only the narrowest scopes that support required behavior.

Potential needs:
- Read calendar availability
- Create and manage events created by the extension

Evaluate whether `calendar.events` plus narrower availability access can replace broader read-only access.

Document each scope in:
- README
- Privacy policy
- Store listing
- OAuth consent screen
- In-product permission explanation

## 14.5 Token handling

- Use Chrome Identity APIs.
- Do not store access tokens in IndexedDB.
- Do not log tokens.
- Remove cached tokens on disconnect.
- Handle 401 by clearing cached token and reauthenticating.
- Never request or store account passwords.
- Never commit tokens in fixtures.

## 14.6 OAuth verification considerations

Before public release:
- Complete OAuth consent screen details.
- Provide accurate application name and support email.
- Publish a privacy policy.
- Verify authorized domains where required.
- Ensure the Chrome Web Store listing and OAuth app identity match.
- Prepare a demonstration video if Google requests verification.
- Explain why each sensitive scope is necessary.
- Remove unused scopes before submission.

## 14.7 Development, staging, and production

Use separate Google Cloud projects:
- Development
- Optional staging
- Production

Benefits:
- Test-user isolation
- Safer credential rotation
- Reduced accidental quota mixing
- Cleaner verification

---

# 15. Security and Privacy Specification

## 15.1 Data classification

Local personal data:
- Saved URLs
- Titles
- Tags
- Notes
- Reading history

Google account data:
- Calendar free/busy information
- Event identifiers
- Created event details

Secrets:
- Release credentials
- Chrome Web Store API credentials
- Signing materials
- CI tokens

## 15.2 Privacy commitments

- No analytics by default.
- No advertising.
- No sale of data.
- No remote article upload.
- No behavioral profiling.
- No hidden telemetry.
- No remote code execution.
- No loading executable code from a CDN.
- No broad browsing-history collection.

## 15.3 Permission minimization

Likely permissions:
- storage
- identity
- alarms
- notifications
- activeTab
- contextMenus
- scripting

Host permissions:
- Google Calendar API endpoints
- Avoid `<all_urls>` unless content extraction requires it.
- Prefer `activeTab` and optional host permissions.

## 15.4 Threat model

Threats:
- Malicious page metadata
- XSS in extension pages
- OAuth token leakage
- Compromised dependency
- Supply-chain attack
- Calendar event injection
- URL containing secrets
- Insecure logging
- Overbroad permissions
- Rogue contributor
- Compromised release credential or maintainer account
- Malicious release artifact

Mitigations:
- Sanitize all external text.
- Never use `innerHTML` for metadata.
- Enforce strict CSP.
- Use dependency review.
- Require PR reviews for release files.
- Protect main branch.
- Use reproducible builds where possible.
- Create checksums for releases.
- Maintain security policy.
- Run local lint, type, test, audit, secret, and package checks before release.
- Keep dependencies minimal.

## 15.5 Sensitive URLs

URLs may contain:
- Session tokens
- Authentication codes
- Private document identifiers
- Email addresses
- Search terms

Mitigation:
- Strip known tracking and authentication parameters.
- Warn before storing suspicious query parameters.
- Never send saved URLs anywhere except Google Calendar when the user confirms an event.
- Offer a privacy mode that stores only title and manually edited URL.

# 16. Coding Style and Standards

## 16.1 Language

- TypeScript strict mode required.
- Avoid `any`.
- Use unknown plus validation for external data.
- Export domain types from dedicated modules.
- Prefer pure functions for scheduling logic.

## 16.2 Naming

- `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- `PascalCase` for components, classes, and types.
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` only for immutable global constants.
- Boolean names begin with `is`, `has`, `can`, or `should`.
- Event handlers begin with `handle`.
- Callback props begin with `on`.

## 16.3 Functions

- Prefer functions under 40 lines.
- One clear responsibility.
- Avoid more than four parameters; use objects.
- Return typed results.
- Do not throw for expected domain outcomes.
- Use result types for recoverable errors.

Example:

```ts
type Result<T, E> =
  | { ok: true; value: T }
  | { ok: false; error: E };
```

## 16.4 Errors

- Use domain-specific error codes.
- Preserve safe technical context.
- Never expose tokens or raw API payloads to users.
- User messages must be actionable.

## 16.5 React

- Functional components only.
- Keep business logic outside components.
- Avoid effects for derived state.
- Use accessible native elements before custom widgets.
- Every modal must trap focus and restore it.
- Every icon-only button needs an accessible label.

## 16.6 Storage

- All persisted records include schema version.
- Migrations are forward-only and tested.
- Writes use transactions where possible.
- No direct storage calls from UI components.
- Storage APIs must be wrapped.

## 16.7 Calendar API

- Centralize API requests.
- Add timeout and retry only for safe idempotent requests.
- Event creation uses an idempotency mechanism.
- Do not blindly retry POST creation.
- Validate all date-time strings.
- Log only non-sensitive diagnostics.

## 16.8 Formatting

- Prettier is authoritative.
- ESLint must pass locally with zero warnings before every push.
- Import order is automated.
- Use LF line endings.
- UTF-8 files.
- Final newline required.

## 16.9 Comments

Comments explain:
- Why a non-obvious decision exists
- Security constraints
- Algorithm trade-offs
- External API limitations

Comments should not restate obvious code.

## 16.10 Documentation

Every exported domain service includes:
- Purpose
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Error behavior
- Side effects

Architectural decisions go in ADR files.

# 17. AI-Assisted Coding Guidelines

## 17.1 Purpose

AI coding tools may accelerate:
- Boilerplate
- Tests
- Refactoring
- Documentation
- Issue decomposition
- Type generation
- Mock data
- Review checklists

AI must not replace verification.

## 17.2 Mandatory rules

- AI-generated code is treated as untrusted until reviewed.
- Never paste OAuth tokens, personal calendar data, or private keys into an AI service.
- Never ask AI to generate dependencies without verifying licenses and maintenance.
- Run formatting, type checking, tests, and security checks after every AI-generated change.
- Keep prompts scoped to one issue.
- Require the AI to explain changed files and assumptions.
- Never merge code the maintainer cannot understand.
- Verify copied code does not violate licenses.
- Prefer official documentation over generated assumptions.
- Record significant AI-assisted decisions in PR descriptions.

## 17.3 Recommended prompt template

```text
Task:
Implement GitHub issue #123.

Context:
- Chrome extension using Manifest V3, React, TypeScript.
- No backend.
- No paid APIs.
- Calendar event creation requires explicit user confirmation.

Constraints:
- Follow docs/coding-standards.md.
- Do not add dependencies without justification.
- Do not modify OAuth scopes.
- Add unit tests.
- Keep changes within listed files unless necessary.

Acceptance criteria:
[Paste issue acceptance criteria]

Output:
1. Brief implementation plan
2. Files changed
3. Code changes
4. Tests added
5. Risks or assumptions
```

## 17.4 AI review checklist

- Does the code invent a nonexistent API?
- Does it use Manifest V2 patterns?
- Does it assume a persistent background page?
- Does it violate service-worker constraints?
- Does it add remote executable code?
- Does it broaden permissions?
- Does it mishandle time zones?
- Does it log private data?
- Does it skip error handling?
- Does it create events without confirmation?
- Does it add unnecessary dependencies?
- Are tests meaningful rather than superficial?

## 17.5 Commit discipline

AI-generated changes should still be:
- Small
- Reviewable
- Issue-linked
- Tested
- Reversible

Avoid "implement entire app" commits.

---

## 22.4 Single-purpose statement

Suggested:

> ReadSlot saves web content and helps users schedule confirmed reading sessions in Google Calendar.

## 22.5 Permission explanations

Examples:

`identity`  
Used to let the user connect their Google account through Chrome's OAuth flow.

`storage`  
Used to store the reading queue and preferences locally.

`activeTab`  
Used only when the user saves the current page.

`alarms`  
Used to trigger session review at the end of a scheduled reading block.

`notifications`  
Used for user-configured reminders and review prompts.

## 22.6 Privacy disclosures

Disclose:
- URLs and titles are stored locally.
- Calendar availability is requested from Google.
- Confirmed reading events are written to the selected calendar.
- No data is sold.
- No advertising.
- No analytics by default.
- No server operated by the project.

## 22.7 Review risk reducers

# 23. Open-Source Strategy

## 23.1 Recommendation

Keep it open source.

Reasons:
- The foundation repository is MIT licensed.
- Open code improves trust for a calendar-connected extension.
- Privacy claims can be inspected.
- Contributors can add browser support and fix edge cases.
- It aligns with a free personal project.
- Users can self-host development credentials.
- Public issue tracking improves transparency.
- It reduces abandonment risk.

## 23.2 Recommended license

Use MIT to remain compatible with the upstream project.

Required:
- Preserve upstream license.
- Preserve copyright notices.
- Add attribution in README and NOTICE.
- Clearly describe major changes.

Example:

> ReadSlot is based on Reading Block by Zara Zhang, licensed under the MIT License. This project substantially modifies the scheduling workflow by replacing automatic event creation with user-confirmed suggestions.

## 23.3 What should remain private

Open source does not mean every operational asset is public.

Keep private:
- Chrome Web Store API credentials
- Future release-automation credentials
- OAuth verification correspondence
- Private signing keys
- Personal test calendars
- Screenshots containing personal data
- Security reports before remediation
- Maintainer account recovery information

## 23.4 Governance

Initial model:
- Benevolent maintainer
- Public roadmap
- Public issues
- Required review for security-sensitive changes
- Contributor license agreement not necessary for MIT at small scale
- Developer Certificate of Origin optional

## 23.5 Contribution boundaries

Accept:
- Bug fixes
- Accessibility improvements
- Browser compatibility
- Tests
- Documentation
- Local-only features

Require deeper review:
- New OAuth scopes
- Analytics
- External services
- Remote code
- New host permissions
- Cloud sync
- Monetization
- Automatic event creation

## 23.6 Sustainability

Even free projects need maintenance.

Sustainable options:
- GitHub Sponsors, optional
- Open Collective, optional
- Contributor rotation
- Clear maintenance status
- Automated dependency updates
- Limited scope
- Scheduled release cadence

Do not introduce monetization unless the product direction changes.

# 25. Local Verification and Release Specification

GitHub Actions are intentionally disabled during the current development phase. Before every
push, run:

- Install with lockfile
- Type check
- Lint
- Format check
- Unit tests
- Component tests
- Build
- Manifest validation
- Permission diff
- Secret scan
- Dependency review
- E2E tests

## Manual release workflow

Before creating a version tag:
- Verify tag matches manifest
- Build production zip
- Generate SHA-256 checksum
- Inspect the artifact and run the manual browser/OAuth checklist
- Create the GitHub release and attach artifacts manually if desired
- Never publish to the Chrome Web Store without maintainer approval

---

# 26. Release and Versioning

Use Semantic Versioning.

Examples:
- `0.1.0`: internal prototype
- `0.5.0`: private beta
- `0.9.0`: public beta
- `1.0.0`: stable

Chrome manifest version must contain one to four dot-separated integers.

Release channels:
- Development
- Beta
- Stable

Changelog categories:
- Added
- Changed
- Fixed
- Security
- Deprecated
- Removed

---

# 27. Observability Without Tracking

Because the project avoids analytics:

Use local diagnostics:
- Last successful calendar sync
- Last error code
- Storage usage
- Extension version
- OAuth state
- Sanitized event-operation log
- Export diagnostics button

Diagnostics must:
- Exclude tokens
- Exclude calendar event content
- Exclude saved URLs by default
- Require user action to export

---

# 28. Product Analytics Without Telemetry

For personal evaluation, show local-only metrics:
- Items saved
- Items scheduled
- Items completed
- Completion rate
- Queue duration
- Oldest item age
- Sessions per week
- Average planned duration
- Average completion percentage

Users can optionally export anonymized aggregate metrics manually for research.

# 29. Risk Register

## High risks

### OAuth verification delays

Mitigation:
- Narrow scopes
- Accurate privacy documentation
- Early production OAuth setup
- Clear demo

### Chrome Web Store rejection

Mitigation:
- Permission minimization
- Single-purpose design
- Complete privacy disclosure
- Manual pre-submission audit

### Time-zone defects

Mitigation:
- Store ISO timestamps
- Use IANA zones
- Extensive tests
- Avoid hand-written date math

### Duplicate events

Mitigation:
- Idempotency keys
- Disable button after click
- Confirm response before retry

### Scope creep

Mitigation:
- MVP gates
- Non-goals
- Issue review
- No paid AI features

## Medium risks

- Storage migration corruption
- Large queue performance
- Unmaintained dependencies
- Browser incompatibility
- Contributor security mistakes
- Private URLs appearing in events

---

# 30. Acceptance Criteria for Version 1.0

- User can save a page in one action.
- Queue persists locally.
- Duplicate pages are detected.
- User can connect Google Calendar.
- User can configure available hours.
- Extension generates at least three candidate blocks when possible.
- Candidate generation creates no calendar events.
- User can edit date, time, duration, reminders, and items.
- Extension rechecks availability.
- Event is created only after explicit confirmation.
- Duplicate clicks do not create duplicate events.
- Session review supports partial completion.
- Unfinished items return to queue.
- User can disconnect Google Calendar.
- User can export and delete local data.
- Privacy policy accurately describes behavior.
- Chrome Web Store package passes review requirements.
- All P0 and P1 tests pass.
- No known critical vulnerabilities exist.

# 32. Final Recommendation

Build ReadSlot as an open-source, local-first fork or derivative of Reading Block under MIT.

Keep the first public release focused on:

1. Capture
2. Queue
3. Calendar connection
4. Suggested blocks
5. Explicit confirmation
6. Session review

Do not add AI, summaries, cloud accounts, or collaborative features before the basic loop proves useful.

The project's trust advantage should be visible everywhere:

- Source code is public.
- Data remains local.
- Permissions are narrow.
- Calendar actions are explicit.
- The extension explains its decisions.
- Users can disconnect, export, and delete everything.

That is a strong and credible product position for a free Chrome extension.
