# ReadSlot

**Schedule what you save.**

Save useful content, find realistic time, and confirm reading blocks in Google Calendar.

ReadSlot is a free, local-first Manifest V3 extension. Saved links, notes, estimates, and
reading history stay in the browser. ReadSlot reads Calendar availability only after the user
connects Google, and it never creates an event without explicit confirmation.

## Development

Requirements: Node 24 and pnpm 11.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm check
```

Load `dist/` from `chrome://extensions` with Developer mode enabled. Calendar features are
disabled until `READSLOT_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` is supplied during the build; see
[`docs/oauth.md`](docs/oauth.md).

## Privacy and permissions

ReadSlot has no backend, advertising, analytics, or remote executable code. See
[`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) for data handling and [`docs/permissions.md`](docs/permissions.md)
for each requested browser permission.
